The orchestral nerd buried in my inner psyche wants to pipe up and tell you to check out Gregory Alan Isakov. Isakov is a massively underrated folk artist from Colorado (by way of South Africa, by way of Philly, by way of...multiple other cities) who just wrapped up a U.S. tour with various national symphony orchestras.

His albums are auditory *saudade* for long gone people and places, and a must-listen for anyone with poetic inclinations - or for lovers of melancholy in general.

*you were a phonograph, i was a kid
i sat with an ear close, just listening
i was there when the rain tapped her way down your face
you were a miracle...i was just holdin’ your space*
