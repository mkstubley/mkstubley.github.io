Laura Marling released a new song from her upcoming album, \*Semper Femina\*, and I could not be more excited for the March release. Says Marling: “I started out writing Semper Femina as if a man was writing about a woman, and then I thought, ‘It’s not a man, it’s me. I don’t need to pretend it’s a man to justify the intimacy, or the way I’m looking and feeling about women. It’s me looking specifically at women and feeling great empathy towards them, and by proxy, towards myself’.”

One of the best things about Marling’s songwriting is the ability to feel seen, and to see yourself in her songs – especially when other artists so rarely acknowledge women and their experiences beyond the surface level. THANK YOU, Laura, for illuminating this special brand of sexism masquerading as romance that is so prevalent...well, everywhere, and not just in the music scene**. Let’s pour one out for all the women who relate.

From “Wild Fire”:

You always say you love me most
But I don’t know I’m being seen
Maybe someday when God takes me away
I’ll understand what the fuck that means
