If you’re in need of a soundtrack to ugly cry along with tonight (#ImStillWithHer), check out my Spotify playlists. I throw together mixes that are equal parts depressing and motivational – perfect for calming anxiety about the next four years and plotting which progressive causes you will sign up to volunteer for.

Listen to May/June 2016 here: https://play.spotify.com/user/12130029879/playlist/2T6yyWKvHFTQeLvdnr8u40
