Hey, this is a quick note to say we’ve migrated to a new website and posts will live here from now on. “Awesome”, you whisper to yourself, “now I can contribute shitpost-y comments in total anonymity!”. Yes, please comment, like, and subscribe! 

Here’s a new playlist which, as always, doesn’t include the background tunes playing at urban outfitters. 

Highlights include:

Saltland - I Only Wish This for You // A cello-centric song from Rebecca Yoon that mourns what could be. 

Kyle Morton - Survivalist Fantasy // I can’t get this song out of my head, especially the imagery evoked by the last chorus. Check out Kyle’s band, Typhoon, if you’re into this. 

Japandroids - North East South West // *Near to the Wild Heart of Life* is a much-needed, well, shot to the heart. Listening to this album makes me feel like I could be sweating in a mosh pit right now in some alternate universe, and the boundless enthusiasm of this band is SO. NEEDED. at the moment. 

Cloud Nothings - Modern Act // Cloud Nothings also released an excellent new album this week. 

Joni Mitchell - A Case Of You // to balance out all of the positivity (jk). I’ve found that wallowing in the occasional Joni Mitchell binge-listening session is an easily achievable method of self-care. Put your phone on silent, turn off the lights, and lie face down in your bed listening to *Blue*. 

I’ll be adding new music throughout the month, so follow along on spotify!
