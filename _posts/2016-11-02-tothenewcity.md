## to the new city:

Oh, hey. My name is Mikala and I’m really into music. This is a side project that originated in my desire to stop spamming friends on social media with “you need to listen to this!!1!” types of posts.

The name of this blog comes from a modest mouse song that talks about a different city+. There have been so many great sites pop up in the last decade, places where people come together and talk about culture. I think there should be new and different communities to talk about music online that aren’t as shout-y as Reddit or as pretentious as Pitchfork. Let’s build a new city.

Feel free to drop me a line, or check out my Spotify playlists (I usually throw one together every month).

+hopefully this blog is not as depressing as that song, though.
