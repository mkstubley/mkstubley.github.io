POLIÇA, an alt-pop band from Minneapolis, put out a useful yet disturbing video at the beginning of the year. The song “Wedding” is about police militarization and the culture of fear in a changing political landscape - which makes it worth re-watching now, in lieu of the possibility that we elect a President Trump (yiiiiikes, btw - volunteer for HRC this week while you still can). The video features young children being coached by muppet-like creatures on how to avoid death at the hands of a police officer, stay safe during a protest, and protect themselves from tear gas using a brightly decorated face mask.
