Zolita, a talented pop singer-songwriter, recently posted an emotionally fraught video for her song ‘Holy’. A group of girls stuck in (what seems to be) a patriarchal schoolhouse form a secret feminist cult. They meet in the woods after compulsory religious classes, wearing secret emblems and pledging fidelity to one another, as a love story develops between Zolita and a feminist comrade in arms at the same time. The ending may not come as a surprise, but it will shake you.
